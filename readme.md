# Neovim config
Welcome to my awful Neovim config!

I'm very new to Neovim and the learning curve of the bindings kept me away from it
for quite a while. Recently decided to give it a proper go rather than delegating it to
the "if I'm in a terminal and there's nothing else" category, and enjoying it
immensely.

This is my config, even over a couple days work its already accumulated debt structurally,
so will probably be rewritten at some point, but it works for now(tm)

## Installation
Install should work out of the box, assuming you already have NodeJS and Rust installed.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/thennothinghappened/nvim-config-bad ~/.config/nvim
$ nvim .
```
