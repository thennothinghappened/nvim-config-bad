# neovim config

Welcome to my new and bare-bones neovim config!

I'm starting this over as I had intended to for a while since the first attempt didn't go too well -
essentially it grew faster than it should've for me to learn properly, making it too much trouble
to work with everything at once rather than build up slowly. Given that, I'm starting again with
something much simpler to get familiar with the *editor* as I should, before jumping into
all the customisation.

We'll see how it goes!

## Installation

The config is currently only really setup to work on my Mac. When I'm next using a different machine
that'll change as needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thennothinghappened/nvim-config-bad ~/.config/nvim && nvim .
```
